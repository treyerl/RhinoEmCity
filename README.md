# RhinoEmCity
Rhino Components to interact with etherEmCity via Luci

Reference [LuciClient.NET](https://github.com/treyerl/LuciClient.NET) by checking it out outside the project folder and then adding it to the project (if the existing link is broken).

Also, you might need to adjust the paths to the referenced Rhino + Grasshopper files.
